# Risk_Score_Model_for_Diabetes_Patients
In this project, you'll build a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.
### Diabetic Retinopathy
Retinopathy is an eye condition that causes changes to the blood vessels in the part of the eye called the retina.
This often leads to vision changes or blindness.
Diabetic patients are known to be at high risk for retinopathy. 
Dataset is about 6000 diabetes patients
### Exploratory Data

Three variables have the largest impact on the model are Age, Syctolic_BP and Cholesterol

We need more data on different relevant features to improve the model.

This model will help doctor have a better retinopathy pronosis in diabetes patients.
